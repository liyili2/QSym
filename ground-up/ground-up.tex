\section{Circuit Basics}

A quantum operator is drawn in the following way in a quantum circuit. We have the convention that information flows from left-to-right. In this
case, $q$ is the name of the input and $q'$ is the name of the output. $F$ is the name of the linear transformation.

\subsection{Serial composition}

Serial composition is given by composition of operators. In the matrix representation, this is matrix multiplication. $G \circ F$ is also often written $GF$.

\subsection{Identity transformation}

The identity transformation, often written $I$, which leaves its input unchanged, corresponds to a wire.

If we want to be very explicit, we can write this out in our circuit diagram. However, this is not usually necessary when writing a circuit diagram (but it can be necessary more often to write the $I$ in symbolic notation).

\subsection{Parallel composition}

Putting two components side-by-side in the circuit corresponds to the tensor product of the operators that the components represent. In
the matrix representation, the tensor product is given by the Kronecker product of the two matrices.

      \node (p1) {$p'$}; &[-0.5cm]

                     (p0) -- (op1)   (op1) -- (p1);
    \end{pgfonlayer}
\end{tikzpicture}
\end{minipage}
  \caption{$F \otimes G$}
\end{figure}

\subsection{The interchange law}

The interchange law says it doesn't matter if we, given four components, we first put two pairs side-by-side and then
hook them up each other, or if we hook them up to each other first. This results in the exact same circuit diagram. We can
write it in two different ways symbolically, and we say that the following equation holds. This is the interchange law.

\[
  (S \otimes T) \circ (F \otimes G) = (S \circ F) \otimes (T \circ G)
\]

The circuit notation has the advantage that this equality always holds implicitly. We never need to actually use it, if we are
drawing circuits (unlike the symbolic notation).

\section{Quantum states: Simplified}

Imagine that we are using classical probability, and that the circuit describes a probabilistic machine.

\subsection{Probabilities as vectors}

We will talk about the probabilities of all of the inputs to a circuit together as a kind of vector. %First

\subsubsection{Tensor products}

The tensor product of two vector spaces produces another vector space. This might sound similar to the direct product of two vector spaces, (which is how you combine $\mathbb{R}$ with itself to get $\mathbb{R}^2$), however it works differently.

The basis of the tensor product space $U \otimes V$ consists of vectors of the form $u \otimes v$, where $u \in U$ and $v \in V$.

\textit{Note}: If the following seems confusing, skim through it and then read the next section. The next section will provide an example.

Consider this function $(u, v) \mapsto u \otimes v$ which sends pairs of vectors $u,v$ from $U$ and $V$ (respectively) to the vector in the tensor product space corresponding to that pair of vectors. The \textbf{key idea} is that we want that function to be \textit{linear} in both its arguments. This means, among other things that, given a scalar $k$, we always have $(k u) \otimes v = u \otimes (k v) = k (u \otimes v)$. We require all of the vector space laws hold by fiat.

Note that this is different from the direct product space, where $k\; (u, v) = (ku, kv)$.

Also, note that, in general, you cannot rewrite $(u \otimes v) + (u' \otimes v')$ as something of the form $s \otimes t$ for any choice of vectors $s$ and $t$. Contrast this with the direct product space where, if we have $(u, v) + (u', v')$ we can always write it as $(u + u', v + v')$. It might seem strange that the tensor product space doesn't have that equality, but this \textbf{important fact} will turn out to be very useful soon.

\subsection{Entanglement: A fictional simplification}

We can talk about how the probabilities are transformed by the operators in the circuit. Now imagine that we have a
deterministic operator which takes in one bit and produces two outputs by duplicating the input bit. This does not correspond to an operator in a quantum circuit and is just for illustration purposes.

    %
    \matrix[row sep=0.4cm, column sep=0.8cm] (circuit) {
      &&\node (q0) {$q_1$}; &[-0.5cm] 
    \coordinate (end0); \\

      \node (p0) {$p$}; &[-0.5cm] 
      \node[operator] (op0) {dup}; &[-0.5cm] 
    \coordinate(end1); \\

      &&\node (q1) {$q_2$}; &[-0.5cm] 
    \coordinate (end2); \\
    %
  };
  \begin{pgfonlayer}{background}
        % Draw background box.
    \node[surround] (background) [fit = (q0) (op0) (p0) (q1) ] {};
        % Draw lines.
        \draw[thick] (p0) -- (op0)   (op0) -- (q0)   (op0) -- (q1);
    \end{pgfonlayer}
\end{tikzpicture}
\end{minipage}
\\

Say we provide an input that has an even chance of being either a 0 or a 1. What is the probability of a 1 appearing at each of the two outputs?
We run into a problem trying to talk about the probabilities in isolation like this. If we say that output $q_1$ has a 1 with probability
$a$ and output $q_2$ has a 1 with probability $b$, we would expect that the output $10$ would have probability $q_1 \cdot (1 - q_2)$. When
we provide an input of $1$ with probability $1/2$, we find the probability of $10$ is $0.5 \cdot (1 - 0.5) = 0.25$. But an
output of $10$ isn't even possible! The operator only duplicates the input. What went wrong?

The \textbf{cause of the mistake} is that the two outputs are \textit{correlated} with each other. Instead of trying to look at the probabilities of the two outputs in isolation, we can
instead say that the output $00$ as a probability of $1/2$ and the output $11$ has a probability of $1/2$ (recall that we are providing it an input of $1$ with probability $1/2$).

This is analogous to how entanglement works in the case of a quantum circuit. In \textbf{quantum terminology}, we would say that the result is that the state is \textit{entangled} or \textit{not separable}. This is in contrast to \textit{separable states}.

Recall that the tensor product. We can write the output probability as $0.5(\ket{0} \otimes \ket{0}) + 0.5(\ket{1} \otimes \ket{1})$. Note that we cannot rewrite this as
$((0.5 \ket{0}) \otimes (0.5 \ket{0})) + ((0.5 \ket{1}) \otimes (0.5 \ket{1}))$. This is one of the crucial differences from the direct product space mentioned previously. If we could do this, it would lead to the exact mistake we made at the start.
