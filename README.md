## Issues

##### Error: "<stdout>: commitBuffer: invalid argument (invalid character XX)" on Windows

> Also may present as a lexer issue on a UTF-8 character.

This is a strange issue, mostly due to the long-standing lack of support for UTF-8 on Windows. A potential fix is enabling the new UTF-8 option in Windows settings. Go to the *language settings*, click *Administrative language settings*, then *Change system locale…* and tick the *Beta: Use Unicode UTF-8 for worldwide language support option*. This will require a restart. If that doesn't work, here are some resources that could help:
